# Todo List Organizer
## Description

I built a day-to-day organizer where the user can type what they have to do for the day and when the user saves their input, it will not be removed unless the user deletes the task and clicks save afterward. The application will also turn grey when the hour has passed, turns red during the current hour, and will be green for the hours that have not past that day. The page will automatically update every 15 seconds and the date will also update when the day has passed.
